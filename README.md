## AVL Tree
Manages set of orderables (i.e. integers) with optional associated values.

* Space: O(n)
* Time:
    - Get Item: O(log n)
    - Set Item/Insert: O(log n)
    - Delete Item/Remove: O(log n)
    - Existence of Item (key in tree): O(log n)
    - Get Length: O(1)
    - Iteration: O(n)
    - Copy: O(n)
